"Consider Me Gone"

You can't stay there
You can't stay there
You can't stay there
You can't stay there

There were rooms of forgiveness
In the house that we share
But the space has been emptied
Of whatever was there
There were cupboards of patience
There were shelf-loads of care
But whoever came calling
Found nobody there
After today
After today
Consider me gone

You can't stay there
You can't stay there
You can't stay there
You can't stay there

Roses have thorns
Shining water's mud
And cancer lurks deep
In the sweetest bud
Clouds and eclipses
Stain the moon and the sun
And history reeks
Of the wrongs we have done
After today
After today
Consider me gone
