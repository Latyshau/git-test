I say love is the seventh wave
I say love is the seventh wave
I say love is the seventh wave
I say love is the seventh wave
I say love is the seventh wave
I say love is the seventh wave
I say love

Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every breath you take with me
Every breath you take, every move you make
Every cake you bake, every leg you break
